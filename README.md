# BountyHub Platform Issue Tracker

This repository is used to track issues and feature requests for the [BountyHub platform](https://bountyhub.org).

## Security

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in BountyHub, please disclose it by sending an email to nikola.jokic@bountyhub.org.

Please refrain from publicly disclosing the bug until the issue has been resolved.

## Bug reports

If something is not working as intended, please write down the bug report. The public issue board can help others see if this is an open issue
and see the progress on it.

**When submitting the bug, please make sure you redact any information that you don't want to be visible to the public**.

## Feature requests

If you want to see a new feature on the platform, and the feature request is not yet submitted, please submit it!

I'd like to point out that the platform is opinionated, so not all feature requests are going to be implemented, at least not right away.

But I would love to hear from you how we can improve the platform together ðŸ’ª!
